pushd allows you to open up new sessions within bash in other folders

popd returns you to your initial session 

cp -r commands bash to copy

directory/ a good habit that will error out if directory doesn't exist

To pushd backwards... 
do a 'pwd' then 'push /xyz/abc/123'

rm -rf <directory> removes directory with files inside

ls -l show file permissions for user, grouop, other
