Exercise 22: What do you know so far? 

Go back through all the exercises and write down every single word and its meaning. 

CHARACTERS
print = prints to the console
float = floating point numbers have a decimal point
modulus = '%' e.g. "X divided by Y with J remaining". J is the result
variable = most any alphanumeric combination that can have any formula, string, integer, or other variable assigned to it. 
formatter = %r, %s, %d can be called to input any assigned term into a printed string
string = anything within " ", typically used for text
integer = any numbers, will usually drop the decimal
round() = lets your round floating point numbers e.g. round(1.7333)
True = 
False = 
raw_input() = allows you to get input from the user, anything between the parentheses is presented to the user just before allowing input
x = int(raw_inpu()) = allows you to get a string and convert it to an integer
input() = can convert input into python code but has security problems
pydoc = 'pydoc x' can be typed into the terminal, works just like terminal man pages
file() = a.k.a. open, opens a file type, returns a file object. types: r,w,a
