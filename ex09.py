# Here's some new strang stuff, remember type it exactly. 

# creats a variable for the days of the week
# these will print on one line because they do not use '\n'
days = "Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun"

# creates a variable for the months
# each month will print on a new line due to the use fo '\n'
months = "Jan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug"

# terminal output begins here
# prints strings and the above-created variables
print "Here are the days: ", days
print "Here are the months: ", months

# this provides a new method for printing strings across new lines
# this is done with the use of two sets of triple (double) quotes """ xx """
# this method appears to be more efficient
print """ 
There's something going on here. 
With the three double-quotes. 
We'll be able to type as much as we like. 
Even 4 lines if we want, or 5, or 6.
